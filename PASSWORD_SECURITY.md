# Password Security Implementation

This document outlines the password security features implemented in the Lanka Basket application.

## Password Requirements

All passwords in the system must meet the following criteria:

### ✅ Minimum Length
- At least 8 characters

### 🔤 Uppercase Letter
- Include at least one uppercase letter (A–Z)

### 🔡 Lowercase Letter 
- Include at least one lowercase letter (a–z)

### 🔢 Number
- Include at least one number (0–9)

### 🔣 Special Character
- Include at least one symbol (e.g., !@#$%^&*()-_+=)

### 🚫 No Spaces
- Password must not contain spaces

## Implementation

### Frontend Validation
- **Real-time validation**: Password strength indicator shows live feedback as user types
- **Visual feedback**: Color-coded strength meter (Red/Yellow/Green)
- **Detailed criteria**: Shows which requirements are met/not met
- **Form submission blocking**: Prevents submission if password doesn't meet criteria

### Backend Validation
- **Server-side checks**: All password requirements validated on server
- **Registration**: Password validation during user registration
- **Password reset**: Validation when users reset their passwords
- **Profile updates**: Validation when users change passwords

### Files Modified

#### Frontend Components
- `client/src/components/PasswordStrengthIndicator.jsx` - Password strength display component
- `client/src/utils/passwordValidation.js` - Client-side validation logic
- `client/src/pages/Register.jsx` - Registration form with password validation
- `client/src/pages/ResetPassword.jsx` - Password reset form with validation

#### Backend Components  
- `server/utils/passwordValidation.js` - Server-side validation logic
- `server/controllers/user.controller.js` - Updated controllers with password validation

## User Experience

1. **Registration Flow**:
   - User enters password
   - Real-time feedback shows which criteria are met
   - Submit button disabled until all criteria met
   - Clear error messages if validation fails

2. **Password Reset Flow**:
   - Same validation applies to new password during reset
   - Visual feedback helps user create strong password

3. **Error Messages**:
   - Client-side: "Password is not strong enough! Please meet all criteria."
   - Server-side: Detailed list of missing requirements

## Security Benefits

- **Brute Force Protection**: Complex passwords resist automated attacks
- **Dictionary Attack Protection**: Special characters and mixed case prevent common password attacks
- **Credential Stuffing Protection**: Unique, strong passwords reduce reuse vulnerabilities
- **Data Breach Protection**: Even if hashed passwords are compromised, strong passwords are harder to crack

## Testing

To test password validation:
1. Navigate to registration or password reset page
2. Enter various passwords to see real-time validation
3. Try submitting with weak passwords to see error handling
4. Ensure strong passwords are accepted

## Examples

### ❌ Weak Passwords
- `password` (missing uppercase, numbers, special chars)
- `Password` (missing numbers, special chars)
- `Password123` (missing special chars)
- `Pass 123!` (contains spaces)

### ✅ Strong Passwords
- `MySecure123!`
- `Lanka@Basket2024`
- `Str0ng&P@ssw0rd`
- `Secure#Pass123`
